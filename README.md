# Oraichain Documentation


This documentation site is automatically deployed to https://docs.orai.io/ 
The main documentation is stored in the `docs` folder

# How to Change the Docs

- install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

- install dependencies
    ```
    $ yarn
    ```
- Run project

    ```
    $ yarn start
    ```
    This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.
- In most times, you only need to add new pages with links on existing pages, such as index.md or *.md in docs folder. These files are all markdown format.
