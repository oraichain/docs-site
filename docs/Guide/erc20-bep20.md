For the time being, ORAI tokens are available in two types - **ERC20** and **BEP20**. The **ORAI native tokens** are set to come in the coming days then ORAI tokens will coexist in every aforementioned shape and form within the Oraichain’s ecosystem.

As the origin of BEP20 ORAI tokens traces back to the **Binance Smart Chain** network (also known as **BSC**) and MetaMask doesn’t come bundled with Binance Smart Chain by default at the moment, you need to configure your wallet a bit in advance.

Follow some simple steps below to install the Binance Smart Chain network in your MetaMask wallet:

**Step 1**: Click on the MetaMask icon and select **Settings** from the dropdown menu.

## How To Convert ORAI ERC20 To BEP20 And Vice Versa?

First things first, keep in mind that you’ve already deposited a certain amount of ORAI tokens, either ERC20 or BEP20, to the wallet address that is currently being in use.

Whether your ORAI tokens are stored in the form of ERC20 or BEP20, you can see them when choosing **Main Ethereum Network** or **Binance Smart Chain** respectively.
