When we call **ORAI**, it means that it is native ORAI tokens created and contained in the Oraichain network. At the beginning, we are basing on ERC20 to issue ORAI token on the Ethereum network that we call **ERC20-ORAI**.

## ORAI token distribution (%)
**The token supply distribution is as follows:**
- Seed Sale Investors comprise 1.00% of the total token supply.
- Private Sale Investors comprise 11.63% of the total token supply.
- Public Sale Investors comprise 13.00% of the total token supply.
- Ecosystem comprises 30.00% of the total token supply.
- Team comprises 17.37% of the total token supply.
- Advisors comprise 7.00% of the total token supply.
- Foundation comprises 20.00% of the total token supply.

**ORAI token release schedule (%)**

All team, advisors, and private sale investors' tokens are locked until mainnet launch.
Therefore, no founders, team members, advisors, or investors in the private sale round will be able to sell ERC20-ORAI tokens on any secondary market at the time of listing or any time prior to the mainnet launch.
We think it is very important to set up the incentives properly for our team and early supporters in the seed sale round.

## Token governance and use of funds
Funds raised in Seed and Private rounds will be spent according to the following allocations:
- 60% technical and business development.
- 20% marketing.
- 10% operation.
- 10% legal and audit fee.

Funds are raised in ETH and then they are converted to stable coins in order to avoid crypto priceâ€™s volatility risk. ETH and stable coins are store in multi-signature wallets that require at least 3 out of 4 signatures from ORAI founders.

## ORAI token utility
When ORAI mainnet is officially launched, the ORAI token is required to secure and power the decentralized oracle network of validators. The native ORAI token is used in different scenarios below:
- Staking for validators: all validators are required to stake ORAI in order to be selected to create a block or fulfill data requests.
- Transaction fee: the ORAI token is required in order to run an AI request sent to the Oraichain network.
- Participation in Oraichain Governance: the Oraichain network is organized in the DAO manner, all protocol upgrades and parameter changes must be voted by token holders.

### Transaction fee
The token plays a role as transaction fee that is paid for parties as follows:
- Request-executing validators
- AI-API providers
- Testcase providers
- Block-creating validators.

Transaction fee is different depending on fee requirement of request-executing validators, AI-API providers, and test-case providers. Transaction fee should be explicitly defined in [MsgRequestData](ProtocolMessages#msgrequestdata) of a request. When a request comes, request-executing validators must decide if they want to execute it. After that, a random validator is chosen from the willing request-executing validators. The chosen validator will execute the oracle script and create MsgResultReport in the end. The validator must clarify the fee paid to AI-API providers, test-case providers, and block-creating validators in the MsgResultReport.

If there are more than one validator asked in the MsgRequestData (AskCount), the transaction fee is divided equally for each validator. The request-executing validators must decide if they accept such transaction fee.

### How ORAI token is mined
The ORAI token is rewarded for each newly created block. The number of rewarded ORAI tokens will be decided later before the mainnet launch. In the Oraichain network, validators are responsible for creating new blocks and a random validator is chosen to do that. In order to become a validator, one needs enough ORAI tokens that are staked or delegated.

### ERC20-ORAI token and ORAI token (native)
There is a mechanism to synchronize ORAI tokens on the Oraichain network and ERC20-ORAI tokens on the Ethereum network. We will announce a conversion bridge later before the mainnet launch.

### Inflation, staking, and Slashing
In order to keep the value of ORAI token, holders must stake their token to the Oraichain network. The rewarding token is divided based on the number of tokens that a holder is staking to a validator.

Slashing is a mechanism to punish bad behavior of validators in aspects of AI API quality, response time, and availability.
