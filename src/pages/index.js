        Staking means earning. By staking your ORAI tokens into one or more validators,
        you will have a chance to participate in the system as a governor while earning more.
        Moreover, by doing so, your contributions also have a positive impact on our operations of the network.

        Users are able to make different requests to AI services that are not easy to find elsewhere,
        as the service providers may not have enough resources to provide a stand-alone AI service application.
        If the services are great, sending funds to these services can be worth considering to allow them grow
        more and more.
